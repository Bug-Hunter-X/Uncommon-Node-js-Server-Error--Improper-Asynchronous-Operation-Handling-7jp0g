# Uncommon Node.js Server Error: Improper Asynchronous Operation Handling

This repository demonstrates a simple Node.js HTTP server and highlights potential uncommon errors that can occur due to improper asynchronous operation handling, third-party library misuse, or memory management issues.  The example server lacks robust error handling, making it vulnerable to these types of bugs.

## Bug Description

The `bug.js` file contains a basic HTTP server. While functional, it lacks error handling, making it susceptible to various runtime issues.  Uncommon errors might arise when dealing with unexpected network conditions, database interactions, or resource exhaustion.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` demonstrates improved error handling and more robust asynchronous operation management.  It showcases how to gracefully handle potential errors and prevent unexpected crashes.
